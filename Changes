- Make the event return false for increments_count, so warnings-related
  failures don't cause test count issues.

- Make the plugin add a prefix to the warning message rather than adding it in
  the event class's summary method.

- Make causes_fail an attribute in the event. It defaults to to true, but can
  be set to false if you'd like to repurpose the event object for something
  else.
